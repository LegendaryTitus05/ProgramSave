            Let's learn how to make our program write! Whatever you write inside the parenthesis and quotations will be
            written by the program. <br/> <br/>
            <&lt;html>
            <div style="margin-left:20px"> &lt;script> </div>
            <div style="margin-left:40px"> document.write("Hello, world!"); </div>
            <div style="margin-left:20px"> &lt;/script> </div>
            &lt;html> <br/> <br/>
            So, whatever you type inside the '("")' part of the "document.write" program will br written, or 'printed' as
            programmers like to call it.
            You can print any letters or numbers. The only thing you can't type inside a 'document.write' are quotation
            marks. You can do this: they said, 'GO AWAY!'
            But not this: they said, "GO AWAY!" I guess there are a few more limitations, but I'll let you figure them out
            on your own. ;)
