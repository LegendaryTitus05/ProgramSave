            Hello! In today's lesson, we're going to be learning about Variables! <br/>
            Variables are things that you can set to a certain number (or letter) and they can also change throughout the program. I'll show you what I mean soon. <br/> <br/>
            First, you write "var". <br/> <br/> "var" <br/> <br/>
            Next, you pick a name. It's usually easy to just do a letter, so we'll start with "a". Add a "=", too. <br/> <br/> "var a =" <br/> <br/>
            Now, add what you want 'a' to be. (number or letter). We'll do it as a "1". <br/> <br/> "var a = 1;" <br/> <br/>
            Okay. Now I'll show you how to use it in a program. <br/> <br/> <br/>
            <div>
                &lt;html&gt;
                <div style="margin-left:20px">
                    &lt;script&gt;
                    <div style="margin-left:20px">
                        var a = 1; <br/>
                        document.write(a + 1"); <br/>
                        document.write(a * 1"); <br/>
                        document.write(a - 1); <br/>
                        document.write(a / 1); <br/>
                    </div>
                    &lt;script&gt;
                </div>
                &lt;html&gt; <br/> <br/>
            </div>
            The outcome of this program would be: <br/>
            2 <br/>
            1 <br/>
            0 <br/>
            1 <br/>
        </div>
